    "# Our git workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a workflow similar to [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Few of us are experts in git, so we have to keep the workflow simple.\n",
    "Thus, *no* complicated branching scheme such as [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Master is king\n",
    "\n",
    "We only have one long-lived branch, which is `master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At any time, a new release can be made out of the latest commit on `master`.\n",
    "- The `master` branch is protected on github, so it is not possible to push directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We use PR\n",
    "\n",
    "All changes go into the `master` branch through **pull requests (PR)** and never by direct commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PR\n",
    "- is automatically tested (CI) and reviewed by at least one colleague before it is merged into `master`.\n",
    "- should be small and concise, to make it easier to review and easier to revert if something went wrong (e.g., the PR contained a bug that was later discovered). Thus, each PR should *not* mix several new features.\n",
    "- goes mainly into `master` through *Squash and merge*, to keep the git history linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We use SemVer\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to versioning our softwares. Every successful PR must be tagged accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## In more details\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to add a new feature or fix a bug, we\n",
    "\n",
    "1. make a branch out of `master`\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    git checkout master # make sure we are on master\n",
    "    git pull --rebase # make sure master is up-to-date\n",
    "    git checkout -b <branchname> # make a new branch\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. do the coding\n",
    "3. commit changes and push them up to github\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    git commit -m 'Clear and concise commit message' # commit changes\n",
    "    git push -u origin <branchname> # push changes to github\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. go to github, open a pull request, wait for all the tests to pass and let someone else look at the code.\n",
    "5. do some more coding and commits\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    git commit -m 'blablabla'\n",
    "    git commit -m 'blablabla again'\n",
    "    git pull --rebase # just in case someone else did some changes to this branch\n",
    "    git push # push to github (only use \"-u origin <branchname>\" for the first push)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Things we might want to add...\n",
    "1. How may CI be helpful for the contributors dev process?\n",
