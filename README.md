# Our git workflow

## Keep it simple

Few of us are experts in git, so we have to keep the workflow simple. Thus, no complicated branching scheme.

## Master is king

We only have one long-lived branch, which is `master`.

All changes goes into `master` through **pull requests (PR)** and never with direct commits. The code is tested and reviewed in the PR. 

## Use SemVer

We are using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to versioning our softwares.
